= Learning JS & NodeJS
This repo is an experement to learn more about NodeJS, related libraries & automation tools.




== Prac 1 Notes
- Basic JS examples & tests.

== Prac 2 Notes
- Using SCSS, NodeJS, webpack & yarn to create a PDF to Text converter.
- Attempt to use non-standard project folder. This causes few problems.
- Webpack output .js file is NOT configured correctly with legacy JS code.
All legacy js code is being "copied" to the output folder.




== Parc 3 Notes



.Goals:
- [ ] Attempt to use webpack correctly using NodeJS modules & default project structure.
based on https://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/structure.html
- [ ] use the http://tooling.github.io/book-of-modern-frontend-tooling/index.html[Book of Modern Fronten Tooling]
to compeletly automate this project.
- [ ] Create a list or guide for Top Must Have NodeJS modules & libraries.
- [ ] Create a list or guide for Top Must Have webpack plugins.



.Tasks:
- [x] Setting up a NodeJS server
- [x] Setup server reloader using _nodemon_
- [x] Setup browser auto reloader using _live-reload-plugin_.
- [ ] Dynamicly generate the livereload.js script tag used by LiveReloadPlugin.
- [ ] Find out which dependencies should be devDepenencies only.
- [x] Auto copy required static assets such as images .
- [ ] Sync changes between ./static & ./dist/static . May need a separate watcher ?
- [ ] Require CDN resources.
- [ ] Add Foundation Site support.
- [ ] Watch .php file changes. (might need to use nodemon?)
- [ ] List all file extensions that need to be watched for change.
- [ ] Add bable support to compile ES5+ code to standard JS.


.Notes:
- To use browser-refresh (recommended), execute `./../node_modules/browser-refresh/bin/browser-refresh app.js `
- To start the server using nodemon (not recommended, use browser-refresh instead) , execute `./../node_modules/nodemon/bin/nodemon.js app.js`
- LiveReloadPlugin uses port 8081

== Lessons Learned
- Use `webpack-livereload-plugin` to reload page not served via nodeJS or webpack server.
FOr example: refresh a php page when CSSS or JS changes are made.


=== Folder Structure with NodeJS and Webpack

 - *bin/* :
 - *build/* : development & production webpack config
- *config/* :
** *config/inded.js* : main project config file.
 - *src/* : This is where most of the application code will go. Structure of content depends on the developer & typ of project.
 - *static/* : Any assets that needs to be only copied  and doesnt need to be process by webpack.
 - *test/* :
 - *web_modules/*
